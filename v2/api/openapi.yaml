      description: Node settings (like CPU / memory) for each node in the cluster.
        The node settings configured at top-level are uniform settings for both tserver
        and master nodes. Granular settings for tserver and master (honoured if dedicated_nodes
        is true or this is k8s cluster) are available for certain node properties.
        Granular settings can also be overridden per Availability Zone. This is part
        of ClusterSpec.
